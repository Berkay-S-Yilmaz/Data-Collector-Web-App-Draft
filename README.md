A Simple Data Collector web app that takes Email and Height data, stores it in a database and then sends them an email with statistics on their height. 
Unfortunatley Google deems the smtplib library (the library used to send the email) as a less secure app therefore blocking the email.

Despite the Failure of this project. It was a good learning experience. I consolidated my knowledge with Flask, learnt how to use new libraries like sqlalchemy,
touched up on my frontend (html, css) skills.
